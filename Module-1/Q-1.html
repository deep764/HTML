Website:
        A website is a collection of web pages and related resources that are hosted on a web server and identified 
        by a common domain name.

        Websites can provide information, entertainment, services, and more. They are accessed using a web browser.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
                A URL is an address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet.
                It's like a unique identification tag for a website or specific webpage.

    A typical URL consists of several parts:

            Protocol: Identifies the way the information is transmitted (often HTTP or HTTPS).
            Domain Name: The name that identifies the website (e.g., [invalid URL removed]).
            Path: The specific location of the resource within the website (e.g., /search).
            Filename (optional): The name of a specific file on the webpage (e.g., index.html).

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

            HTTP is the foundation of communication between web browsers and web servers.
            It defines the rules for how data is formatted and transmitted when you access a website.
            HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a more secure version of HTTP that encrypts 
            0communication to protect data privacy.
