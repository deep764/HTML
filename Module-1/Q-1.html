Website:
        A website is an assemblage of web pages and associated materials that are stored on a web server and recognized by a shared domain name.

Websites can offer services, entertainment, information, and much more. A web browser is used to view them.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
                                An address that indicates where a resource is located on the internet is called a 
                                URL.
                                It functions similarly to a distinctive webpage or website identifying tag.

    A typical URL consists of several parts:

                                Protocol: Indicates the information transmission method (often HTTP or HTTPS).
                                Domain Name: The name (such as [invalid URL deleted]) used to identify the website.
                                Path: The resource's precise position on the website (e.g., /search).
                                Filename: The name of a particular file on the website, such as index.html, is optional.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

                                The communication protocol used by web servers and browsers is called HTTP.
                                It lays out the guidelines for the format and transmission of data when you visit 
                                a website.
                                The most secure HTTP is called HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), which 
                                encrypts 0 communication to safeguard the privacy of data.
