What do you understand by CSS opacity?

Transparency Scale: Opacity is defined by a numeric scale ranging from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 
                    (completely opaque, fully solid).
Visibility: An element with 0 opacity will be invisible, but it will still occupy space on the web page. 
            Higher opacity values make the element more and more visible.
Element vs. Content: The opacity property applies to the entire element, including its background and any child 
                     elements it contains. This means all the content inside the element will also be affected by 
                     the opacity value.

Use Cases of Opacity:

Fading Effects: Opacity is commonly used to create fading effects on hover or other interactions. 
                For example, you can make an image partially transparent when the user hovers over it.
Overlays and Backgrounds: By setting a semi-transparent background, you can create overlays or subtle effects 
                          without completely hiding the underlying content.
Highlighting or Focus: Opacity adjustments can be used to highlight specific elements or focus areas on a web page.
