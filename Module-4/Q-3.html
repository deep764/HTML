What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?

Structure:

Modular Design: The biggest difference is that CSS3 is broken down into smaller, modular sections. This allows for 
                more focused development and easier adoption of new features by browsers. CSS2 was a single 
                specification.

Features:

New Capabilities: CSS3 introduces a wide range of new features not found in CSS2, including:

                More advanced layout options with Flexbox and Grid.
                Multi-column layouts for text.
                Rounded corners and borders.
                Animations and transitions.
                Gradients and more complex background effects.
                Text shadows and other visual effects.
                Responsive design features like media queries.
                3D transformations.

Improved Functionality: CSS3 builds on the foundation of CSS2 and offers improvements to existing features like
                        colors (opacity), box model properties, and selectors.

Browser Support:

Generally Better Support: Modern browsers generally offer good support for CSS3 features. However, 
                          it's still a good idea to check for compatibility with older browsers if you need to 
                          support them.
                          
Legacy Support: CSS2 is generally well-supported by all browsers as it's been around for a longer time.
