What are the benefits of using CSS.

Separation of Concerns: CSS separates the presentation (how things look) from the content (what the information is).
                        This makes code cleaner and easier to manage.

Consistency: With CSS, you can apply styles to multiple web pages at once, ensuring a consistent look and feel 
             across your entire website.

Faster Loading Times: CSS reduces the amount of HTML code needed to style a web page. This means pages load faster, 
                      especially for repeat visitors whose browsers can cache the CSS styles.

Responsive Design: CSS allows you to create responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
                   This is crucial in today's world where people access websites from phones, tablets, laptops, 
                   and desktops.

Easier Maintenance: If you need to make a change to the style of your website, you can simply edit the CSS file. 
                    This is much easier than having to edit the HTML code on every single page.

Accessibility: CSS can be used to create websites that are accessible to people with disabilities. 
               For example, you can use CSS to increase the font size or change the color contrast for people 
               with visual impairments.

Print-Friendly Pages: With CSS, you can create styles specifically for printing. This ensures that your web pages 
                      look good when printed out on paper.

Advanced Design Techniques: CSS allows you to create more advanced design effects, like animations and hover 
                            effects. This can make your website more visually appealing and engaging for users.
