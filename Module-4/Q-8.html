What is the use of the background-position property?

The background-position property in CSS is used to control the initial placement of a background image (or gradient) within its container element.

Positioning:  It defines the starting position of the background image relative to the background positioning area 
              (set by background-origin property). By default, this area is the element's content box.

Values: It accepts various values to specify the image's position:

            Keywords: You can use keywords like top, left, right, bottom, or center to position the image relative 
                      to the edges of the element's box (e.g., background-position: top left;).

            Lengths and percentages: You can specify pixel values (e.g., 20px 10px) or percentages (e.g., 25% 75%) 
                                     to position the image relative to the element's box. With two values, the first
                                     value represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical
                                     position.

Here are some common use cases for background-position:

Aligning an image in a specific corner: Use keywords like top left or bottom right to place the image in those 
                                        corners.

Centering an image: Use the center keyword horizontally or vertically (or both) to center the image within the 
                    element.
Precise positioning: Use pixel or percentage values to achieve more granular control over the image's placement 
                     within the element.

Additional points to consider:

By default, if you only specify one value for background-position, the second value is assumed to be center.
You can use up to four values to define offsets for multiple background images or for more complex positioning 
scenarios.
