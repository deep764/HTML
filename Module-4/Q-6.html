How can the background color of an element be changed?

Using CSS:

CSS is the most common and recommended way to style elements on a webpage, including changing their background 
color.Here's how to do it:

        Identify the element: You'll need to know how to target the specific element you want to change the 
                              background color for. This can be done using element tags (e.g., div, p, h1), class 
                              names, or IDs assigned to the element in the HTML code.

        Use the background-color property: In your CSS code, you can define a style rule that targets the element 
                                           and sets the background-color property. The value of this property can 
                                           be a color name (e.g., "red", "blue"), a hex code (e.g., "#FF0000" for 
                                           red), or an RGB value (e.g., "rgb(255, 0, 0)" for red).

Example:

/* Target all div elements */
div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/* Target an element with a specific ID */
#myElement {
  background-color: yellow;
}

Using JavaScript:

While less common, JavaScript can also be used to change the background color of an element dynamically. 
This can be useful for interactive elements that change color on hover or click events.

Example:

document.getElementById("myElement").style.backgroundColor = "red";
