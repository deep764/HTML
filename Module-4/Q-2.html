What are the disadvantages of CSS?

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Different web browsers may interpret CSS code slightly differently, which can lead to 
                             inconsistencies in how your website looks across different platforms. This can require 
                             extra time and effort to ensure your website displays correctly everywhere.
Learning Curve: While the basics of CSS are relatively easy to learn, mastering more advanced techniques can take 
                time and practice.
Security Concerns: CSS itself doesn't have built-in security features. Malicious actors can potentially exploit 
                   vulnerabilities in CSS to inject malicious code into your website.
Limited Layout Control for Complex Designs: For very intricate layouts, CSS might require workarounds or additional
                                            frameworks like Flexbox or Grid to achieve the desired design.
Performance Impact: Extensive or poorly written CSS code can increase the file size and slow down your website's 
                    loading time.
Overriding Styles and Maintenance Challenges: With large websites or multiple developers working on the code, 
                                              there's a risk of styles accidentally overriding each other. 
                                              This can make maintaining consistent website aesthetics more 
                                              difficult.
