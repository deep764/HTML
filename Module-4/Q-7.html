How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?

Target the element: Similar to changing background color, you'll need to identify the element where you want to 
                    control the background image repetition using CSS selectors in your style sheet.

Use the background-repeat property: This property defines how the background image tiles within the element's 
                                    background area. It accepts different values for various repetition behaviors:

repeat-x: Repeats the image horizontally across the element's width.
repeat-y: Repeats the image vertically across the element's height.
repeat: Repeats the image in both horizontal and vertical directions (default behavior).
no-repeat: Displays the image only once, at the top-left corner of the element by default.

Example:

/* Repeat image horizontally */
element {
  background-image: url("image.jpg");
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

/* Repeat image vertically */
element {
  background-image: url("image.jpg");
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
}

/* No repetition (display once) */
element {
  background-image: url("image.jpg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
