Name a few CSS style components.

<h1> to <h6> headings: You can use CSS to style headings (h1-h6) with properties like font-size, font-weight, 
                       color, and margin.
Paragraphs (<p>): Similarly, CSS can style paragraphs with properties like font-family, line-height, and 
                  text-indent.
Images (<img>): Use CSS to control image sizing with width and height, add borders and padding, and apply effects
                like opacity.
Links (<a>): Style the appearance of links (text color, underline, hover effects) and define how they behave on 
             hover or visit with CSS.
Lists (<ul> and <ol>): Control the appearance of list items with CSS, including styling the numbering/bulleting, 
                       spacing, and margins.
Tables (<table>): Use CSS to style table elements like borders, background colors, font styles for headers and 
                  data cells.
