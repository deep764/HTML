How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? With Example.

In HTML, it is not possible to merge multiple cells into one, but you can give the impression that you can by 
utilizing the colspan and rowspan attributes.

colspan: This property indicates how many columns a given cell should span. 
         It is positioned inside the cell you wish to enlarge's opening <td> tag.

rowspan: This property indicates how many rows a given cell should span.
         It is positioned inside the opening <td> tag, just like colspan.

Example:

<table>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Product</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Shirt</td>
      <td>T-Shirt</td>
      <td>$10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dress Shirt</td>
      <td>$20</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
