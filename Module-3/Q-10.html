How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? With Example.

You can't actually combine cells into a single cell in HTML, but you can create the illusion of merging cells 
using the colspan and rowspan attributes.

colspan: This attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span. 
         It's placed within the opening <td> tag for the cell you want to expand.

rowspan: This attribute specifies the number of rows a cell should span.
         Similar to colspan, it's placed within the opening <td> tag.

Example:

<table>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Product</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Shirt</td>
      <td>T-Shirt</td>
      <td>$10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dress Shirt</td>
      <td>$20</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
