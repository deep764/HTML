How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.

Here's how to create a hyperlink in HTML:

Open the <a> tag: This is the opening tag that defines the start of the hyperlink.

Set the href attribute: This attribute specifies the destination of the link. 
                        It can be an absolute URL (including the protocol, like https:// or http://),
                        a relative URL (relative to the current page's location), or other valid link types 
                        like email addresses (mailto:) or file paths.
    
Add the link text: The text between the opening and closing <a> tags defines the visible clickable part of the 
                   hyperlink. This can be text, an image, or even another HTML element.
    
Close the <a> tag: This marks the end of the hyperlink definition.

Example:

<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit our website</a>

Additional attributes:

title: This attribute specifies advisory information about the link, shown as a tooltip when hovering over the link.

Example:

<a href="https://www.example.com" title="The official website of Example Company">Visit our website</a>

target: This attribute defines how the linked content should load. By default, links open in the same window. 
        You can use values like _blank to open the link in a new tab or window.
