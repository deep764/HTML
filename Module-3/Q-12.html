How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.

This is how an HTML hyperlink is made:

The <a> tag is the opening tag that indicates where the hyperlink begins. Open it.


Assign the href property: This property indicates the link's destination. 
                        It can be an absolute URL (which includes the protocol, such as https:// or http://), a relative URL (which is based on the location of the current page), or any other kind of acceptable link, such as file paths or email addresses (mailto:).
    
Include the text for the link: The visible clickable portion of the hyperlink is defined by the text that appears between the <a> tags that open and close. This might be another HTML element, some text, or even a picture.
    
Close the tag <a>: The definition of a hyperlink ends here.

Example:

<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit our website</a>
