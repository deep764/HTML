What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

Applying styles: You can use CSS styles to target individual text parts by using the class or id attributes contained within the span tag. This gives you the option to style a specific word, phrase, or collection of inline elements in a different way than the surrounding text.


JavaScript interactions: To group components for JavaScript manipulation, use the span tag. 
                         You can use JavaScript to target a specific content segment for dynamic effects or 
                         interactions by giving the span a unique class or ID.

Highlighter or emphasis: If you need to accomplish a comparable level of highlighting, you can use span with CSS, 
                         however semantic elements like <strong> and <em> are suggested for importance or emphasis.


Example:
HTML:
<p>This is a sentence with a <span class="important">highlighted word</span>.</p>


CSS:
.important {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: red;
  }
