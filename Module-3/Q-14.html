What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

Applying styles: You can use the class or id attributes within the span tag to target specific sections of text 
                 with CSS styles. This allows you to style a particular word, phrase, or group of inline elements 
                 differently from the surrounding text.

JavaScript interactions: The span tag can be used to group elements you want to manipulate with JavaScript. 
                         By assigning a unique class or ID to the span, you can target that section of content 
                         using JavaScript for dynamic effects or interactions.

Highlighter or emphasis: While semantic elements like <strong> and <em> are preferred for importance or emphasis, 
                         you can use span with CSS to achieve similar highlighting if needed.

Example:
HTML:
<p>This is a sentence with a <span class="important">highlighted word</span>.</p>


CSS:
.important {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: red;
  }

  This will display the sentence "This is a sentence with a highlighted word." with the word "highlighted" 
  appearing bold and red.
