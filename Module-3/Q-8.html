What are the various formatting tags in HTML?

Text Formatting:

<b> (bold) & <strong> (important): Both make text bold, but with a slight difference.<b> emphasizes visual weight, 
                                   while <strong> indicates that the information is important for understanding the 
                                   content.

<i> (italic) & <em> (emphasized): Similar to bold tags, <i> slants text for emphasis, while <em> adds emphasis 
                                  semantically, suggesting the content is stressed or different.

<sub> (subscript) & <sup> (superscript):** These tags format text as subscripts (used for chemical formulas, etc.)
                                        and superscripts (used for exponents, etc.).

<mark> (marked text):** Highlights a section of text with a background color, 
                     often used to indicate relevant passages.

<small> (smaller text) & <big> (larger text):** While deprecated and not recommended for modern websites, these \
                                                tags adjust the font size of the text.


Structural Formatting:

Headings (<h1> to <h6>):** Define headings of different levels, with <h1> being the most important and <h6>
                           the least.

<p> (paragraph):** Creates a block of paragraph text.

<br> (line break):** Inserts a single line break within a paragraph.

<hr> (horizontal rule):** Creates a horizontal line to visually separate content sections.


Lists:

<ul> (unordered list):** Creates an unordered list with bullet points.
<ol> (ordered list):** Creates an ordered list with sequential numbers.
<li> (list item):** Defines each item within an unordered or ordered list.

Other Formatting:

<blockquote> (quotation):** Indents and formats quoted text.
<code> (code):** Displays text in a monospaced font, often used for code snippets.
<pre> (preformatted text):** Preserves whitespace and formatting within the text, useful for poems or code samples.
