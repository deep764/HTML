What are void elements in HTML? With Example.

No Content: They cannot contain any text or other elements within their opening and closing tags.
Self-Closing:Void elements only require a starting tag and don't need a separate closing tag. 
             While technically optional, you can include a forward slash (/) at the end of the opening tag 
             for consistency (e.g., <br /> vs. <br>).
Attributes: Despite not having content, void elements can still have attributes that provide additional information 
            about the element.
Here are some common examples of void elements in HTML:

<br> (Line Break): This element inserts a line break within your text, creating a new line.
<hr> (Horizontal Rule): This element creates a horizontal line to visually separate sections of your content.
<img> (Image): This element inserts an image into your webpage. You use the src attribute to specify the image 
               file location.
<input> (Input Field): This element creates an input field for user interaction, such as text boxes, checkboxes, or 
                       radio buttons. It uses various attributes like type to define the input type.
<link> (External Link): This element establishes a link between your HTML document and an external resource, 
                        like a stylesheet or another web page.
