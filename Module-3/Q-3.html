What are void elements in HTML? With Example.

No Content: The opening and closing tags cannot hold any text or other items.
Self-Closing: A void element doesn't need a separate closing tag; it just needs a starting tag. 
             Although it's not required, you can conclude the beginning tag with a forward slash (/). 

             to ensure uniformity (e.g., <br /> versus <br>).
Features: Although void elements lack content, they may nevertheless include features that offer further details 
          about the element.

Typical instances of void elements in HTML include the following:

<br> (Line Break): This element adds a new line to your content by inserting a line break.
<hr> (Horizontal Rule): This element divides your material into sections by drawing a horizontal line.
<img> (Image): This component adds a picture to your website. To indicate the location of the image file, 
               use the src attribute.
<input> (Input Field): This element generates an input field, such as a text box, checkbox, or radio button, for 
                       user interaction. It defines the input type using a variety of properties, such as type.
<link> (External Link): This element creates a connection between your HTML document and an outside source, such as 
                        a different webpage or stylesheet.
