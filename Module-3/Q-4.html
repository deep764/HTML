What are HTML Entities? With Example.

Structure: The elements of an HTML entity are an ampersand (&), a character name or a number, and a semicolon (;) 
to finish.
Categories: Entities typically fall into two categories:
Character Entities: For the copyright symbol (©), these employ character names such as &copy; that characterize the 
symbol. 

In general, familiar symbols are easier to memorize.

Character Entity Examples:

Because the ampersand itself has a specific meaning in HTML entity definition, & stands in for the ampersand sign 
(&).
" stands for the double quote symbol (").
The apostrophe (') is represented as ', and the less than symbol (\) by \.
The symbol > stands for the greater than sign (>).


Numerical Entity Samples:

&#169; is the symbol for copyright (©).
The registered trademark symbol (®) is represented by &#174;.

The Euro symbol (€) is represented by &#8364;. Benefits of Using Entities:

Display Reserved Characters: These let you display characters (like < and >) in HTML that have a specific meaning 
without the browser reading them as code.
Non-Standard Characters: These let you use symbols that some keyboards might not support.
Consistent Appearance: Entities guarantee that characters are rendered consistently in various browsers and devices.
