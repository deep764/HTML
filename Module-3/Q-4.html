What are HTML Entities? With Example.

Structure: An HTML entity consists of an ampersand (&), followed by either a character name or a number, ending with a semicolon (;).
Types: There are two main types of entities:
Character Entities: These use character names that describe the symbol, like &copy; for the copyright symbol (©). 
                    These are generally easier to remember for common symbols.
Numeric Entities: These use a number code representing the character's position in a character set, like &#169; 
                  for the copyright symbol.
                  
Examples of Character Entities:

&amp; represents the ampersand symbol (&) because the ampersand itself has a special meaning in HTML entity definition.
&quot; represents the double quotation mark (")
&apos; represents the apostrophe (')
&lt; represents the less than sign (<)
&gt; represents the greater than sign (>)

Examples of Numeric Entities:

&#169; represents the copyright symbol (©)
&#174; represents the registered trademark symbol (®)
&#8364; represents the Euro symbol (€)
Benefits of Using Entities:

Display Reserved Characters: They allow you to display characters that have a special meaning in HTML, like < and >, without the browser interpreting them as code.
Non-Standard Characters: They enable you to include symbols that might not be available on all keyboards.
Consistent Appearance: Entities ensure consistent character rendering across different devices and browsers.
