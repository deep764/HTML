What are logical and physical tags in HTML?

Logical Tags:

Focus on the meaning and structure of the content.
Describe the content's role or purpose within the document.
Do not directly affect the visual appearance of the text.
Browsers have some default way of presenting content marked with logical tags, but this can be overridden with 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

Examples of Logical Tags:

<blockquote> (Block Quotation) - Indicates a quoted passage.
<em> (Emphasis) - Marks text with emphasis.
<strong> (Strong Emphasis) - Marks text with strong emphasis.
<cite> (Citation) - Indicates a title of a creative work.
<abbr> (Abbreviation) - Indicates an abbreviation or acronym.

Physical Tags:

Focus on the visual presentation of the content.
Directly control how the text appears on the screen (bold, italics, font size, etc.).
Do not convey any specific meaning about the content itself.

Examples of Physical Tags:

<b> (Bold) - Makes text bold (deprecated, use CSS instead).
<i> (Italics) - Makes text italic (deprecated, use CSS instead).
<sup> (Superscript) - Positions text as superscript.
<sub> (Subscript) - Positions text as subscript.
<font> (Font) - Specifies font face, size, and color (deprecated, use CSS instead).
