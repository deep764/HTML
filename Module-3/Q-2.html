What are tags and attributes in HTML?

Tags:

Function: Tags act like signposts, indicating the type of content a particular section holds.
Structure: Written in angle brackets (<>), they mark the beginning and end of an HTML element.
Example: The <h1> and </h1> tags define a heading element on the webpage.
Attributes:

Function: Attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of an HTML element.
Placement: They are included within the opening tag of the element.
Structure: Attributes come in name-value pairs, separated by an equal sign (=) and enclosed in quotes (either single or double).
Example: The <img> tag inserts an image. The src attribute within the opening tag specifies the location of the image file 
(e.g., <img src="image.jpg" alt="A descriptive text">). Here, "src" is the attribute name and "image.jpg" is the 
value. The "alt" attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is useful for accessibility.
