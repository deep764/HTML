What are tags and attributes in HTML?

Labels:

Tags serve as signposts, showing the kind of content that is contained in a given section.
Structure: The start and stop of an HTML element are indicated by angle brackets (<>).
An example of a heading element on a webpage is defined by the <h1> and </h1> tags.

Qualities:

Attributes add information or change the behavior of an HTML element.
Placement: They are contained in the element's beginning tag.
Structure: Name-value pairs containing attributes are contained in quotes (either single or double) and separated by an equal sign (=).

Example: To insert an image, use the <img> tag. The location of the image file is specified by the src attribute in
 the opening element (e.g., <img src="image.jpg" alt="A descriptive text">). In this case, the property name is 
 "src" and the value is "image.jpg". Accessibility benefits from the alternate text provided by the "alt" element 
 for the image.
