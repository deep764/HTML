What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.

An HTML document can contain another document, such as a movie, webpage, or other web content, by using the iframe tag. It basically opens a window for external content to be shown on your webpage.


Including external movies: By utilizing the iframe tag and the supplied embed code, you may incorporate videos straight into your webpage from websites like Vimeo or YouTube. This removes the requirement for viewers to navigate away from your website in order to view the video.

Presenting dynamic material: Stock quotes, news feeds, live sports scores, and other frequently updated content can all be displayed using iframes. In this manner, it is possible to separately update the external material without having to reload the entire webpage.

Including maps: Interactive maps from resources like Google Maps can be embedded.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Video with iframe</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Watch this cool video</h1>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</body>
</html>
