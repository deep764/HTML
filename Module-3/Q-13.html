What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.

The iframe tag in HTML is used to embed another document, like a whole webpage, video, or other web content, 
within the current HTML document. It essentially creates a window within your webpage to display external content.

Embedding external videos: You can embed videos from services like YouTube or Vimeo directly into your webpage 
                           using the iframe tag and the provided embed code. This eliminates the need to leave your 
                           website for users to watch the video.

Displaying dynamic content:  Iframes can be used to display content that updates frequently, like stock quotes, 
                             news feeds, or live sports scores. This way, the external content can be refreshed 
                             independently without reloading the entire webpage.

Adding maps: You can embed interactive maps from services like Google Maps using iframes. This allows users to 
             explore the map location directly on your webpage.

Creating advertisements: While not the most user-friendly approach, iframes can be used to display advertisements 
                         from external providers.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Video with iframe</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Watch this cool video</h1>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</body>
</html>

Important considerations when using iframes:

Security:Be cautious when embedding content from untrusted sources, as iframes can introduce security 
         vulnerabilities.
Accessibility:Ensure the embedded content is accessible for users with disabilities, as iframes might create 
              navigation challenges.
Content control:You generally have less control over the appearance and behavior of the embedded content compared 
                to native HTML elements.
