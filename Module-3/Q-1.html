Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

HTML Tags: These are the written instructions that define the start and end of an element. 
           They are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). For instance, <h1> and </h1> are tags for a heading 
           element.

HTML Elements: An element is the entire structure formed by the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. 
               It represents a specific part of your webpage and its content. So, the element includes everything 
               between <h1> and </h1>, along with the text you put inside those tags (like "My First Heading").
