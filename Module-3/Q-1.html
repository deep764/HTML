Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

HTML Tags: These are the textual instructions that specify an element's beginning and ending. 
           Angle brackets (< and >) enclose them. For example, tags for a heading element are <h1> and </h1>.


HTML Elements: The beginning tag, the content, and the closing tag together constitute the full structure that is 
               called an element. 
               It stands for a certain section of the content on your webpage. Thus, the element comprises all text 
               inside in <h1> and </h1> tags (e.g., "My First Heading") as well as everything between those tags.
