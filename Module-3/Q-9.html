How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.

Cell Padding:

Function: Specifies the distance from a table cell's border to its contents.
Impact: Makes a space between each cell's content and itself.
HTML Attribute: Managed by the <table> tag's cellpadding attribute.

Example:

<table cellpadding="10">
    <tr>
      <td>This text has padding</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

-------------------------

Cell Spacing:

Function: Specifies the distance between a table cell's border and its neighbor.
Impact: Makes spaces between cells, which modifies the arrangement of the table as a whole.
HTML property: Managed by the <table> tag's cellspacing attribute.

Example:

<table cellspacing="10">
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

--------------------------------

Visualization: Picture a table that resembles a grid. While cell spacing generates spaces between the boxes 
               themselves, cell padding makes room inside each individual grid box, surrounding the content.



--------------------------------

Selecting Between Cell Spacing and Padding:

When you wish to create space around each cell's content to enhance readability or make the text stand out visually, 
use cell padding.

When you wish to create space between cells—perhaps for improved organization or aesthetics—use cell spacing.

For the table layout you want, you can usually combine cell spacing and cell padding.
