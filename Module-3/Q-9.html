How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.

Cell Padding:

Function: Defines the space between the content of a table cell and its border.
Impact: Creates a margin around the content within each cell.
HTML Attribute: Controlled using the cellpadding attribute of the <table> tag.

Example:

<table cellpadding="10">
    <tr>
      <td>This text has padding</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

-------------------------

Cell Spacing:

Function: Defines the space between the borders of adjacent table cells.
Impact: Creates gaps between individual cells, affecting the overall table layout.
HTML Attribute: Controlled using the cellspacing attribute of the <table> tag.

Example:

<table cellspacing="10">
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

--------------------------------

Visualization:
                Imagine a table like a grid. Cell padding creates space inside each individual box of the grid, 
                around the content, while cell spacing creates gaps between the boxes themselves.

--------------------------------

Choosing Between Cell Padding and Cell Spacing:

Use cell padding when you want to add space around the content within each cell, making it visually stand out or 
improving readability.

Use cell spacing when you want to create separation between cells themselves, potentially for better 
organization or aesthetics.

You can often use both cell padding and cell spacing together to achieve your desired table layout.
