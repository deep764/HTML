How are active links different from normal links?

Normal Link:

This is the default state of a hyperlink.

It indicates a clickable element that, when clicked, leads to another web page, document, or section of the 
current page (depending on the link's destination).

By default, normal links are typically underlined and blue in color, but this can be customized using CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets).

Active Link:

An active link represents the current state of a hyperlink when a user interacts with it. This interaction can 
involve:
        Clicking and holding the mouse button on the link (without releasing).
        Right-clicking on the link to open a context menu.
Visually, active links often change appearance to provide feedback to the user. The default behavior might be to 
change color (e.g., to red) and remain underlined. Again, the specific visual style can be customized using CSS.
