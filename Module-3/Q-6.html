What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.

The class attribute in HTML is a powerful tool for associating CSS styles and JavaScript functionality with 
specific elements on your webpage. It acts like a label you can assign to elements.

Here's a breakdown of the class attribute:

Function:  It assigns one or more class names to an HTML element.
Placement: The class attribute is included within the opening tag of the element.
Structure: The class names are separated by spaces 
           (e.g., <p class="highlight important">This text is important!</p>).

Benefits of Using the class Attribute:

Reusable Styles: By assigning a class name to multiple elements, you can apply the same styles 
                 (defined in CSS) to all those elements at once. This promotes code maintainability and 
                 consistency.
Targeted Scripting: JavaScript can target elements with specific class names to perform actions or 
                    manipulate their behavior.
Flexibility: You can assign multiple classes to a single element, allowing for more complex styling 
             combinations.


Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .important 
  {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  .highlight 
  {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="important">This text is important!</p>
  <p class="highlight">This text is highlighted.</p>
  <p class="important highlight">This text is both important and highlighted!</p>
</body>
</html>
