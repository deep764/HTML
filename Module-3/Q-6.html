What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.

When it comes to linking particular items on your website with JavaScript functionality and CSS styling, the class 
attribute in HTML is a very useful tool. It functions much like a label that you may put on items.

This is how the class attribute is broken down:

Its function is to provide an HTML element one or more class names.
Placement: The element's beginning tag has the class attribute.
Structure: Class names (e.g., \p class="highlight important">This content is important!</p>) are separated by spaces.


Take Advantage of the class Attribute:

Reusable Styles: You can apply the same styles (specified in CSS) to several items at once by giving each element a 
class name. This encourages the maintainability of programs and uniformity.
JavaScript has the ability to target items with particular class names in order to execute commands or change their 
behavior. This technique is known as targeted scripting.
Flexibility: Multiple classes can be applied to a single element, enabling more intricate styling combinations.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .important 
  {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  .highlight 
  {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="important">This text is important!</p>
  <p class="highlight">This text is highlighted.</p>
  <p class="important highlight">This text is both important and highlighted!</p>
</body>
</html>
