What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.

Three primary list types are available in HTML for presenting information in an orderly fashion:

Bulleted List (Ordered List):


used for things that don't have a set order.
The <ul> (unordered list) tag defines this.
The <li> (list item) element defines each item in the list.
Browsers show unordered lists with bullet points (usually in the form of circles or discs) by default.


Example:-

<ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ul>

  
  This code will produce:

  Coffee
  Tea
  Milk
-------------------------
Ordered List (Numbered List):

Used for items with a specific order of importance or sequence.
Defined by the <ol> (ordered list) tag.
Each item within the list is defined by the <li> (list item) tag.
By default, browsers display ordered lists with sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...).List in Order (Numbered List):

used for things that have a certain sequence or order of importance.
specified by the ordered list (<ol>) tag.

The <li> (list item) element defines each item in the list.
Browsers show sorted lists with sequential numbers by default (1, 2, 3...).


Example:

<ol>
    <li>First Step</li>
    <li>Second Step</li>
    <li>Third Step</li>
  </ol>

  This code will produce:

  First Step
  
  Second Step
  
  Third Step
  -------------------------------
  Description List (Definition List):

  Used to define terms and their associated descriptions.
  Defined by the <dl> (definition list) tag.
  Each term is defined by the <dt> (definition term) tag.
  The corresponding description for the term is defined by the <dd> (definition description) tag.  

Example:

<dl>
    <dt>HTML</dt>
    <dd>HyperText Markup Language, used for creating web pages.</dd>
    <dt>CSS</dt>
    <dd>Cascading Style Sheets, used for styling web pages.</dd>
  </dl>

  This code will produce:

  HTML: HyperText Markup Language, used for creating web pages.
  CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, used for styling web pages.
