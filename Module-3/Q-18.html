What is SVG?

Vector-Based Graphics:

Unlike JPEGs and PNGs, which are raster-based (made up of pixels), SVG uses vector graphics.
Vector graphics define images through mathematical formulas using points, lines, and curves.
This makes SVG images infinitely scalable without losing quality. 

Text-Based Format:

SVG files are actually stored as XML text files. This means they can be edited with text editors or vector 
graphics software.
The text-based nature of SVG also allows for searching, indexing, and scripting within the image itself.

Common Uses of SVG:

Logos and icons
Infographics and charts
Illustrations and diagrams
Interactive elements like buttons and menus
