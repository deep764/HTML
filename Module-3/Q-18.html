What is SVG?

Graphics Utilising Vectors:

SVG employs vector graphics as opposed to raster-based JPEGs and PNGs, which are composed of pixels.
With the use of mathematical formulas and points, lines, and curves, vector graphics define images.

SVG pictures can now be scaled indefinitely without sacrificing quality. 

Text-Oriented Format:

In reality, SVG files are kept as XML text files. This implies that text editors and vector graphics programsÂ can 
be used to edit them.

Because SVG is text-based, it may also be used for internal scripting, indexing, and searching within the image.
