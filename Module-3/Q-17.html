What are the different tags to separate sections of text?

(Line Break):

By inserting a single line break, this tag advances the text cursor to the start of the subsequent line.
For small paragraph breaks or brief text passages like addresses, use <br>.


<p> (Paragraph):

This tag delineates a text paragraph. The paragraph content is automatically surrounded by some space before and after.
For discrete, logical text chunks in a document, use <p>.

Usually used for lengthy quotes or extracts, this tag denotes quoted or indented content.
To distinguish <blockquote> from the body of text, browsers frequently render it with indentation or other visual cues.
