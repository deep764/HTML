What are the different tags to separate sections of text?

<br> (Line Break):

This tag inserts a single line break, moving the text cursor to the beginning of the next line.
Use <br> for minor breaks within a paragraph or for short lines of text like addresses.

<p> (Paragraph):

This tag defines a paragraph of text. It automatically adds some space before and after the paragraph content.
Use <p> for distinct logical sections of text within a document.

<blockquote> (Block Quotation):

This tag indicates quoted or indented text, typically used for long quotations or excerpts.
Browsers often render <blockquote> with indentation or visual distinction to set it apart from the main text.

<h1> to <h6> (Headings):

These tags define headings of different levels, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> the least.
Headings structure your document and improve readability.
Search engines also use headings to understand the content's hierarchy.

<hr> (Horizontal Rule):
        
This tag inserts a thematic break, typically displayed as a horizontal line.
Use <hr> to visually separate sections or content blocks.
