What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements? With Example.

id Attribute:

Uniqueness: An id attribute must be unique within a single HTML document. There can only be one element with a 
            specific id value on a page.
Purpose: Primarily used to target a single, specific element for styling or scripting.
Selection Method (CSS): The id selector (#) is used to target elements with a specific id in CSS.
Selection Method (JavaScript): JavaScript's getElementById() method is used to access elements by their id.


class Attribute:

Uniqueness: A class attribute can be assigned to multiple elements on the same page.
Purpose: Used to group elements that share similar characteristics or styling needs.
Selection Method (CSS): The class selector (.) is used to target elements with a specific class name in CSS. 
                        You can also target elements with multiple classes using combinations 
                        (e.g., .important.warning).
Selection Method (JavaScript): JavaScript's getElementsByClassName() method is used to retrieve a collection of 
                               all elements with a specific class name.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  #special-heading {
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
  .important {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="special-heading">This is a special heading</h1>
  <p class="important">This text is important.</p>
  <p class="important">This text is also important!</p>
</body>
</html>
