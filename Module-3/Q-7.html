What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements? With Example.

id Property:

Uniqueness: Within a single HTML document, an id property needs to be unique. On a page, there can only be one 
element with a given id value.
Mostly used to focus styling or scripting efforts on a single, particular element.
Selection Method (CSS): In CSS, elements with a certain id are targeted using the id selector (#).
JavaScript Selection Method: To access elements by their id, use the getElementById() method.

class Characteristic:

Uniqueness: Several components on the same page may be allocated the same class property.
Useful for clustering items with comparable properties or stylistic requirements.

CSS Selection Method: To target elements with a given class name, use the class selector (.) in CSS. 
                      Additionally, you can use combos (such as.important.warning) to target components with 
                      several classes.

JavaScript Selection Method: To receive a collection of all items with a certain class name, use the  
                             getElementsByClassName() method in JavaScript.


Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  #special-heading {
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
  .important {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="special-heading">This is a special heading</h1>
  <p class="important">This text is important.</p>
  <p class="important">This text is also important!</p>
</body>
</html>
