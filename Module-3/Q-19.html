What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

Structure and Syntax:

HTML: - HTML is more forgiving in its syntax. It allows for some errors or inconsistencies without breaking the 
        webpage's functionality. - Tags are not case-sensitive (e.g., <body> is the same as <BODY>). - Empty 
        elements can sometimes omit closing tags (e.g., <br>).
XHTML: - XHTML is stricter and follows the rules of XML (Extensible Markup Language). - XHTML requires proper 
         nesting of tags and all tags must be lowercase. - Empty elements must have a closing tag, even if it's 
         just a forward slash (/>).

Purpose and Development:

HTML: - HTML is the foundational language for web pages. It's designed to be simple and flexible to allow for 
        creativity and adaptation over time.
XHTML: - XHTML was created as a stricter version of HTML aimed at better integration with other XML technologies 
         and data formats. It aimed to improve data exchange and validation.

Popularity and Use Today:

HTML: - HTML is the dominant language for web development. - Modern HTML versions (HTML5) have incorporated some 
        stricter elements and features, but it remains generally more flexible than XHTML.
XHTML: - XHTML never gained widespread adoption and development largely stopped after HTML5 emerged. - Modern 
         browsers can handle both HTML and XHTML, but HTML is the recommended standard for new web pages.
