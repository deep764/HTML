What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

Block-level elements:

New line: They always start on a new line before and after the element itself.
Full width: They expand horizontally to fill the available space from left to right within their container.
Margins: Block-level elements typically have top and bottom margins by default.
Examples: <p>, <div>, <h1>, <table>, <ul>

Inline elements:

Flow with text: They flow inline with the surrounding text, sitting on the same line without forcing a new line.
Width as content: They only take up the horizontal space needed for their content.
No margins: Inline elements generally don't have top and bottom margins by default.
Examples: <span>, <b>, <i>, <a>, <img> (without additional styling)

Here's an analogy: Imagine a block-level element as a separate building block for your webpage structure, 
                   like a heading or a paragraph. An inline element is more like part of the furniture within
                   a building block, such as a bolded word or an image within a paragraph.
