What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

Block-level components:

New line: Both before and after the element itself, they always begin on a new line.
Whole width: They spread out horizontally within their container to occupy all available space, left to right.

Margins: By default, block-level items have top and bottom margins.
For instance, <p>, <div>, <h1>, <table>, and <ul>.

Linear components:

Flow with text: They don't force a new line; instead, they sit on the same line as the surrounding text.
Content width: They occupy only the horizontal space required by their content.
    
No margins: By default, inline items don't have top or bottom margins.
<span>, <b>, <i>, <a>, and <img> are some examples (without further styling)
    
Here's a comparison: Consider a block-level element as a distinct section, such as a headline or paragraph, of your webpage's structure. A bolded word or a picture inside a paragraph are examples of inline elements; they are more akin to pieces of furniture within a building block.
