Do search for domain, hosting, SEO etc.

Domain: A domain name is a unique identifier that acts as the address of your website on the internet. 
        It's what people type into their web browser to reach your site (e.g., [invalid URL removed]).

Hosting: Website hosting refers to the service of storing your website's files on a special computer called a web 
         server. This server makes your website accessible to visitors on the internet.  There are different 
         hosting providers offering various plans with features like storage space, bandwidth, security, and email 
         accounts.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): SEO is the practice of improving the ranking and visibility of your website in 
                                  search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal is to attract organic traffic 
                                  (visitors who find your site through search engines) by making your website 
                                  relevant to specific search queries.  SEO techniques involve optimizing your 
                                  website's content, structure, and technical aspects to signal to search engines 
                                  that your site is a valuable resource for users.
